# Hangman Game

## Overview
This is a simple Hangman game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows players to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

## Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML document that contains the structure of the game interface.
- `src/styles/style.css`: The CSS file that styles the game interface, including layout, colors, and fonts.
- `src/scripts/app.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic, manages the game state, and handles user interactions.

## How to Play
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. A hidden word will be displayed with underscores representing each letter.
3. Enter a letter in the input field and click the "Guess" button.
4. If the letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the correct position(s).
5. If the letter is not in the word, you will lose a guess.
6. The game continues until you either guess the word or run out of guesses.
